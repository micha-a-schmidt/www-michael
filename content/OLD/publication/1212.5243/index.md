abstract = "The  recent  LHC  discovery  of  a  Higgs-like  resonance  at  126  GeV  suggests  that  the  minimal supersymmetric standard model must be modified in order to preserve naturalness.  A simple extension  is  to  include  a  singlet  superfield  and  consider  the  scale-invariant  NMSSM,  whose renormalizable  superpotential  contains  no  dimensionful  parameters.   This  extension  not  only solves the μ-problem, but can easily accommodate a 126 GeV Higgs.  We study the naturalness of the scale-invariant NMSSM taking into account the recent constraints from LHC searches,flavor  physics  and  electroweak  precision  tests.   We  show  that  TeV-scale  stop  masses  are  still allowed in much of the parameter space with 5% tuning for a low messenger scale of 20 TeV, split families (with third-generation sleptons decoupled) and Higgs-singlet coupling λ of order one.  For larger values of the Higgs-singlet coupling, which can relieve the tuning in the Higgs VEV, an additional tuning in the Higgs mass limits increasing the (lightest) stop mass beyond 1.2 TeV, the gluino mass above 3 TeV, and electroweak charginos and neutralinos beyond 400 GeV for a combined tuning better than 5%.  This implies that the natural region of parameter space for the scale-invariant NMSSM will be fully explored at the 14 TeV LHC"
