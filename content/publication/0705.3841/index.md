abstract = "We carefully analyze the renormalization group equations in the type I + II seesaw scenario in the extended standard model (SM) and minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). Furthermore, we present analytic formulae of the mixing angles and phases and discuss the RG effect on the different mixing parameters in the type II seesaw scenario. The renormalization group equations of the angles have a contribution which is proportional to the mass squared difference for a hierarchical spectrum. This is in contrast to the inverse proportionality to the mass squared difference in the effective field theory case. "
