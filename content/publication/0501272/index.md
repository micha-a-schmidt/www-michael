abstract = "We systematically analyze quantum corrections in see-saw scenarios, including effects from above the see-saw scales. We derive approximate renormalization group equations for neutrino masses, lepton mixings and CP phases, yielding an analytic understanding and a simple estimate of the size of the effects. Even for hierarchical masses, they often exceed the precision of future experiments. Furthermore, we provide a software package allowing for a convenient numerical renormalization group analysis, with heavy singlets being integrated out successively at their mass thresholds. We also discuss applications to model building and related topics."
