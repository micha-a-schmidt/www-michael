abstract = "We study the prospects for testing classes of atmospheric mixing sum rules at precision neutrino facilities. Such sum rules, which correlate the atmospheric mixing angle theta23 with the recently measured reactor angle theta13 and the cosine of the oscillation phase delta, are predicted by a variety of semi-direct models based on discrete family symmetry, classified in terms of finite von Dyck groups. We perform a detailed simulation of the performance of the next generation of oscillation experiments, including the wide band superbeam and low-energy neutrino factory proposals, and compare their discriminating power for testing atmospheric mixing sum rules."
